# Orange-Juice-Sales-Analysis
Sales analysis of two high-priced and one low-priced orange juice brands

In this project, we are given a dataset about orange juice sale acquired from Dominicks database to analyze. Given more than a dozen of different brands, we are to choose only two high-priced brands and one lower-priced one and be more specific about our results. We also have developed different research questions to analyze the relationship between price, brands, locations, and many more. Based on our analysis, we generated models, validate our models, and made predictions.

This report encompasses detailed analysis of our models generated and intuitive visualizations to help our targeted audience to better understand the information we try to convey.
